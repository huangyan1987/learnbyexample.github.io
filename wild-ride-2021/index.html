And this was possible only because it was online. The topic was Python scripting introduction for Biotech students. Publishing "100 Page Python Intro" was timely for this workshop.<p>This took up most of my time during March/April along with updating existing books.</p><br><h2 id=blog-posts>Blog posts<a aria-label="Anchor link for: blog-posts" class=zola-anchor href=#blog-posts>🔗</a></h2><p>I've been consistently writing books for the past three years, but I find it difficult to come up with ideas for my programming blog. This is partly due to not wanting to repeat content from my books. Here's my favorite posts I wrote this year:<ul><li><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/my-book-writing-experience/>Paying my bills with 'free' ebooks</a><li><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/gnu-bre-ere-cheatsheet/>GNU BRE/ERE cheatsheet and differences between grep, sed and awk</a><li><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escaping-madness-awk-literal-field-separator/>Escaping madness to get literal field separators in awk</a><li><a href=https://www.perl.com/article/perl-one-liners-part-1/>Perl / Unix One-liner Cage Match, Part 1</a> and <a href=https://www.perl.com/article/perl-one-liners-part-2/>Perl / Unix One-liner Cage Match, Part 2</a></ul><p>I tried to be more consistent by posting short articles (see <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/mini/>mini posts list</a>), but lost interest. Starting a newsletter in November helped change my perspective about re-using content from my books. I've started posting tips and coding challenges that are short and easy to digest:<ul><li><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/tips/>Programming tips</a><li><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/numeric-palindrome/>Numeric Palindrome</a><li><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/counting-nested-braces/>Counting nested braces</a></ul><p>I was more consistent for my <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/>Escapist Reviews</a> blog that I started late last year to review novels I read.</p><br><h2 id=book-sales>Book sales<a aria-label="Anchor link for: book-sales" class=zola-anchor href=#book-sales>🔗</a></h2><p>Had better sales compared to last year, which I really wasn't expecting. Especially when the average monthly sales was around $100 between May to September (my monthly expenses is around $150). This coincided with some health issues and the struggle to finish writing the "Practice Python Projects" book.<p>This led me to reading articles about better landing pages, building audience on social media, affiliates, etc. I still have a long way to go, but I feel these active efforts led to much improved sales in the last quarter of the year. I ended up deciding not to use affiliates though.<p>Here's my sales chart from Gumroad for this year (I had similar revenue from Leanpub):<p align=center><img alt="Gumroad sales in 2021" src=/images/books/gumroad_sales_2021.png><p>There were plenty of reasons that led to the awesome last quarter sales. Here's some significant events I remember:<ul><li>Joined hands with fellow Python authors for <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/indie-python-extravaganza/>The Indie Python Extravaganza</a> bundle (given away freely for a month) <ul><li>A Twitter discussion led to the giveaway idea, which resulted in creating this bundle<li>Combined marketing efforts by all four of us gave significant paid sales too</ul><li>Published "Command line text processing with GNU Coreutils" <ul><li>In addition to my usual practice of making a new book free, this time I offered <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/all-books>All books bundle</a> for $5 and a lot of users bought it<li>Announcing the book on Reddit and Hacker News was well received<li>I was beginning to improve my Twitter audience around that time, which helped a bit<li>Got featured in Leanpub's monthly sales newsletter<li>Jesse Smith on <a href="https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20211206#book">distrowatch.com</a> wrote a lovely book review, which resulted in significant sales in December</ul><li>Getting featured on <a href=https://rubyweekly.com/issues/574>Ruby weekly</a><li><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/programming-deals/>Programming deals</a> for the last week of November <ul><li>Helped a lot by commenting on Hacker News and getting featured in blog posts of fellow Python authors</ul><li><a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/python-25-days-of-regex/>Interactive GUI app for Python regex</a> <ul><li>As part of 50 days of break from book writing, I worked on this Python app<li>Made it to the front page of Hacker News yet again</ul><li>"The Indie Python Extravaganza" bundle and some of my other books were featured in Leanpub's Boxing day sales<li>And I believe creating <a href=https://github.com/learnbyexample>GitHub Readme</a> helped as well</ul><p>The biggest takeaway for me was to actively look for opportunities (small or big) instead of just relying on <em>free</em> offering during book launch (which is about once in four months).</p><br><h2 id=newsletter>Newsletter<a aria-label="Anchor link for: newsletter" class=zola-anchor href=#newsletter>🔗</a></h2><p>During the 50 days break, the other significant project I started was <a href=https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly>learnbyexample weekly</a> newsletter. This is still in early stages to point out any impact it will have on my book sales, but it certainly has been a pleasure so far to email an issue every Friday.<p>And as mentioned earlier, this led me to write programming blog posts consistently (tips and coding challenges).</p><br><h2 id=building-twitter-audience>Building Twitter audience<a aria-label="Anchor link for: building-twitter-audience" class=zola-anchor href=#building-twitter-audience>🔗</a></h2><p>I joined Twitter in 2015. My follower count was less than 400 in July. In December, I crossed 1100. This is far from being impressive (I know a few authors who added more than 15000 followers during that time period).<p>Being active on Twitter led me to awesome opportunities mentioned earlier in the Book sales section. The best tips I can give is to tweet consistently, interact with your readers and don't be afraid to participate in conversations initiated by top users. Oh, and reading articles/books about social media audience building would help too.<p><a href=https://twitter.com/learn_byexample>Follow me on Twitter</a> for interesting tech nuggets 😉</p><br><h2 id=fictional-reading>Fictional reading<a aria-label="Anchor link for: fictional-reading" class=zola-anchor href=#fictional-reading>🔗</a></h2><p>I enjoy reading fantasy and science-fiction novels. I read 80+ SFF books this year and recently wrote a post listing <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/lists/2021-favorite-sff-novels/>my top 10 favorites</a>.<p>I also got a chance to beta read <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57289544-the-siege-of-skyhold>The Siege of Skyhold</a> and an ARC of <a href=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58656291-bastion>Bastion</a>. I find these a good way to give back to the writing community, having myself received plenty of support from strangers.</p><br><h2 id=goals-for-2022>Goals for 2022<a aria-label="Anchor link for: goals-for-2022" class=zola-anchor href=#goals-for-2022>🔗</a></h2><p>Foremost goal is to continue taking care of physical/mental health. And I'd be more than happy if I manage yet another year with $250+ average monthly income.<p>Books:<ul><li>I'm currently working on <a href=https://learnbyexample.github.io/vim_reference/>Vim Reference Guide</a> ebook.
