      <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Started and ended the year well, with a depressing period in the middle. Published three programming ebooks, several blog posts, started a newsletter, improved Twitter readership, read 80+ novels, and so on. Had a good year in terms of ebook sales 😇</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><br>
<h2 id="books-published">Books published<a class="zola-anchor" href="#books-published" aria-label="Anchor link for: books-published">🔗</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/100_page_python_intro">100 Page Python Intro</a> — short, introductory guide for the Python programming language. Started writing last year, published in February</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample/practice_python_projects">Practice Python Projects</a> — five beginner to intermediate level projects inspired by real world use cases. Started writing last year (before &quot;100 Page Python Intro&quot;!), published in July</li>

</ul>
<p>I also spent time updating all my existing books from February to May.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/books/2021_books.png" alt="Programming books published in 2021" /></p>
<br>
<h2 id="workshops">Workshops<a class="zola-anchor" href="#workshops" aria-label="Anchor link for: workshops">🔗</a></h2>
<p>First and only workshop I conducted since the start of pandemic in 2020. And this was possible only because it was online. The topic was Python scripting introduction for Biotech students. Publishing &quot;100 Page Python Intro&quot; was timely for this workshop.</p>
<p>This took up most of my time during March/April along with updating existing books.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="blog-posts">Blog posts<a class="zola-anchor" href="#blog-posts" aria-label="Anchor link for: blog-posts">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I've been consistently writing books for the past three years, but I find it difficult to come up with ideas for my programming blog. This is partly due to not wanting to repeat content from my books. Here's my favorite posts I wrote this year:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/my-book-writing-experience/">Paying my bills with 'free' ebooks</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/gnu-bre-ere-cheatsheet/">GNU BRE/ERE cheatsheet and differences between grep, sed and awk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/escaping-madness-awk-literal-field-separator/">Escaping madness to get literal field separators in awk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.perl.com/article/perl-one-liners-part-1/">Perl / Unix One-liner Cage Match, Part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.perl.com/article/perl-one-liners-part-2/">Perl / Unix One-liner Cage Match, Part 2</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I tried to be more consistent by posting short articles (see <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/mini/">mini posts list</a>), but lost interest. Starting a newsletter in November helped change my perspective about re-using content from my books. I've started posting tips and coding challenges that are short and easy to digest:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/tips/">Programming tips</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/numeric-palindrome/">Numeric Palindrome</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/counting-nested-braces/">Counting nested braces</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I was more consistent for my <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/">Escapist Reviews</a> blog that I started late last year to review novels I read.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="book-sales">Book sales<a class="zola-anchor" href="#book-sales" aria-label="Anchor link for: book-sales">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Had better sales compared to last year, which I really wasn't expecting. Especially when the average monthly sales was around $100 between May to September (my monthly expenses is around $150). This coincided with some health issues and the struggle to finish writing the &quot;Practice Python Projects&quot; book.</p>
<p>This led me to reading articles about better landing pages, building audience on social media, affiliates, etc. I still have a long way to go, but I feel these active efforts led to much improved sales in the last quarter of the year. I ended up deciding not to use affiliates though.</p>
<p>Here's my sales chart from Gumroad for this year (I had similar revenue from Leanpub):</p>
<p align="center"><img src="/images/books/gumroad_sales_2021.png" alt="Gumroad sales in 2021" /></p>
<p>There were plenty of reasons that led to the awesome last quarter sales. Here's some significant events I remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joined hands with fellow Python authors for <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/indie-python-extravaganza/">The Indie Python Extravaganza</a> bundle (given away freely for a month)
<ul>
<li>A Twitter discussion led to the giveaway idea, which resulted in creating this bundle</li>
<li>Combined marketing efforts by all four of us gave significant paid sales too</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Published &quot;Command line text processing with GNU Coreutils&quot;
<ul>
<li>In addition to my usual practice of making a new book free, this time I offered <a href="https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/all-books">All books bundle</a> for $5 and a lot of users bought it</li>
<li>Announcing the book on Reddit and Hacker News was well received</li>
<li>I was beginning to improve my Twitter audience around that time, which helped a bit</li>
<li>Got featured in Leanpub's monthly sales newsletter</li>
<li>Jesse Smith on <a href="https://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20211206#book">distrowatch.com</a> wrote a lovely book review, which resulted in significant sales in December</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Getting featured on <a href="https://rubyweekly.com/issues/574">Ruby weekly</a></li>
<li><a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/programming-deals/">Programming deals</a> for the last week of November
<ul>
<li>Helped a lot by commenting on Hacker News and getting featured in blog posts of fellow Python authors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/python-25-days-of-regex/">Interactive GUI app for Python regex</a>
<ul>
<li>As part of 50 days of break from book writing, I worked on this Python app</li>
<li>Made it to the front page of Hacker News yet again</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&quot;The Indie Python Extravaganza&quot; bundle and some of my other books were featured in Leanpub's Boxing day sales</li>
<li>And I believe creating <a href="https://github.com/learnbyexample">GitHub Readme</a> helped as well</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest takeaway for me was to actively look for opportunities (small or big) instead of just relying on <em>free</em> offering during book launch (which is about once in four months).</p>
<br>
<h2 id="newsletter">Newsletter<a class="zola-anchor" href="#newsletter" aria-label="Anchor link for: newsletter">🔗</a></h2>
<p>During the 50 days break, the other significant project I started was <a href="https://learnbyexample.gumroad.com/l/learnbyexample-weekly">learnbyexample weekly</a> newsletter. This is still in early stages to point out any impact it will have on my book sales, but it certainly has been a pleasure so far to email an issue every Friday.</p>
<p>And as mentioned earlier, this led me to write programming blog posts consistently (tips and coding challenges).</p>
<br>
<h2 id="building-twitter-audience">Building Twitter audience<a class="zola-anchor" href="#building-twitter-audience" aria-label="Anchor link for: building-twitter-audience">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I joined Twitter in 2015. My follower count was less than 400 in July. In December, I crossed 1100. This is far from being impressive (I know a few authors who added more than 15000 followers during that time period).</p>
<p>Being active on Twitter led me to awesome opportunities mentioned earlier in the Book sales section. The best tips I can give is to tweet consistently, interact with your readers and don't be afraid to participate in conversations initiated by top users. Oh, and reading articles/books about social media audience building would help too.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/learn_byexample">Follow me on Twitter</a> for interesting tech nuggets 😉</p>
<br>
<h2 id="fictional-reading">Fictional reading<a class="zola-anchor" href="#fictional-reading" aria-label="Anchor link for: fictional-reading">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I enjoy reading fantasy and science-fiction novels. I read 80+ SFF books this year and recently wrote a post listing <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/escapist-reviews/lists/2021-favorite-sff-novels/">my top 10 favorites</a>.</p>
<p>I also got a chance to beta read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57289544-the-siege-of-skyhold">The Siege of Skyhold</a> and an ARC of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58656291-bastion">Bastion</a>. I find these a good way to give back to the writing community, having myself received plenty of support from strangers.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="goals-for-2022">Goals for 2022<a class="zola-anchor" href="#goals-for-2022" aria-label="Anchor link for: goals-for-2022">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Foremost goal is to continue taking care of physical/mental health. And I'd be more than happy if I manage yet another year with $250+ average monthly income.</p>
<p>Books:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm currently working on <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/vim_reference/">Vim Reference Guide</a> ebook. Likely to publish in the first quarter</li>
<li>I started working on <a href="https://learnbyexample.github.io/cli_text_processing_rust/">Command line text processing with Rust tools</a> ebook even before &quot;Command line text processing with GNU Coreutils&quot;, hope to publish in 2022</li>
<li>Have several more book topics in mind, but not sure if I'll start working on any of them. And it is possible that I'll come up with something else I fancy and work on it instead of already planned topics</li>
</ul>
<p>Projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactive apps for exercises from other books, similar to the one I did for Python regex</li>
<li>Games for fun</li>
</ul>
<p>Miscellaneous:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue to build an audience via Twitter, Newsletter, etc</li>
<li>Contribute to other open source projects</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Here's wishing you a very happy, healthy and prosperous 2022 👍 😇</p>
